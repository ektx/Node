# GraphQL vs REST: Overview

GraphQL 与 REST 概览

> A few months back I wrote a comparison between RPC and REST for Smashing Magazine, and now I want to talk about the differences between REST and GraphQL: the new kid on the block.

在几个月前,我写了一个PRC与REST不同的文章,今天我们再来谈谈REST和GraphQL:一种新型的接口.

> GraphQL is incorrectly considered by some to be a "replacement" to REST. GraphQL is newer concept, being released by Facebook publicly in 2015, whereas REST was a dissertation published by Roy Fielding in 2000, popularized by companies like Twitter(quite inaccurately) in 2006.

有些人将 GraphQL 错误地认为是对 REST 的"替代".GraphQL是一种新的概念,它由Facebook在2015年开源,然而 REST 由 Roy Fielding 在2000年发布,其流行程度就像Twitter在2006年.
